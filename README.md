Iâ€™m excited to share a video walkthrough of my completed machine learning assignments as part of the #CodvedaInternship at @Codveda Technologies. Every line of code and analysis is my own work, reflecting my commitment to integrity and hands-on learning.

What I Built:



ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Random Forest for Churn Prediction

Developed a Random Forest classifier from scratch using scikit-learn and pandas.

Performed hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature importance analysis.

Visualized results and built an interactive Streamlit app for exploration.



ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Classification

Implemented SVM models with both linear and RBF kernels.

Compared kernel performance, visualized decision boundaries, and evaluated with standard metrics.

Provided both script and interactive app versions.



ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Feed-Forward Neural Network with TensorFlow/Keras

Built a flexible neural network for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and custom datasets.

Designed customizable architectures, trained models, and visualized training/validation loss.

Created a Streamlit app for interactive model building and evaluation.

Letâ€™s connect if you want to discuss machine learning, data science, or internship experiences.



Why I Used Streamlit for the UI:

I chose Streamlit as the user interface for my machine learning projects because it allows rapid development of interactive web applications with minimal code. Streamlit makes it easy to visualize data, tune model parameters, and display results in real timeâ€”all directly from Python scripts. This approach provides a user-friendly experience for both technical and non-technical users, enabling seamless exploration and analysis of machine learning workflows without the need for complex front-end development. Streamlitâ€™s integration with popular libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn made it the ideal choice for building intuitive, interactive dashboards for my assignments.
